### To test the plugin on a local 4.x ASpace instance:

1. Go to https://github.com/archivesspace/archivesspace/releases
1. For the archivesspace release you'd like to test, download the archivesspace-docker zip file
1. Unzip the file
1. cd into the uncompressed archivesspace-docker directory
1. In `config/config.rb`, uncomment the array of plugins and add `date_builder`
1. `cd plugins`
1. `git clone git@github.com:pulibrary/date_builder.git`
1. `docker compose up -d`
1. Enter the docker container: `docker compose exec -it app bash`
1. Navigate into `archivesspace` and initialize the plugin: `./scripts/initialize-plugin.sh date_builder`
1. Wait for aspace to come up.  It will take several minutes.
